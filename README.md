The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake that moves around a rectangular grid or screen. The objective of the game is to guide the snake to eat food items (usually represented by dots or apples) that appear randomly on the grid. As the snake consumes the food, it grows longer, making the game progressively challenging.
In this version of snake, a draw file called stddraw is used to run snake from the command prompt. The game fuctions the same as the classic arcade-style snake game, however five apples are spawned at all times allowing for faster growth, but incerasing the difficulty.
